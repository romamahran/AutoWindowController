A brushed DC motor has a fixed magnet (called the stator) and a rotating coil (called the rotor). It is simple, low-cost, and provides high starting torque, which makes it suitable for industrial applications. However, it requires regular maintenance because the brushes wear down over time. In contrast, a brushless DC motor does not use brushes. Instead, it relies on an electronic speed controller (ESC) to switch the current and control rotation. Brushless motors are more efficient (typically 85â€“90%) and require less maintenance. Although they are more expensive due to the need for an external controller, they are preferred for long-term use or applications that need precision and efficiency.

2. Motor Encoders vs Servo Motors vs Stepper Motors
A motor encoder is a sensor attached to a motor shaft that provides feedback about speed, direction, and position. It is useful in systems where accurate feedback and control are needed. A servo motor has a built-in control system and feedback mechanism, allowing it to move precisely to a specific position or angle. Servo motors are commonly used in robotic arms and similar applications. A stepper motor moves in discrete steps rather than continuous rotation. It does not require feedback to move accurately and is widely used in applications like 3D printers and CNC machines where precise step-by-step movement is needed.

3. Communication Protocols
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a simple communication protocol that uses two wires for one-to-one communication. It is easy to implement and provides a medium data rate, making it suitable for basic data exchange between two devices. I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) also uses two wires but allows multiple devices to communicate over the same bus. It is slower than SPI but is perfect for connecting sensors and other low-speed peripherals. SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) uses four wires and provides much faster data transfer compared to UART and I2C. It supports multiple devices but involves more complex wiring, making it ideal for high-speed communication tasks.

Code Explanation
The project uses two Arduino boards connected through I2C communication. The master Arduino reads the light intensity from a photoresistor and the temperature from a temperature sensor. It converts the readings and sends both values to the slave Arduino over the I2C protocol. The slave Arduino receives the data and controls a servo motor, which represents an automated window shutter. Based on the light level, the servo motor adjusts the shutter: it opens fully in strong light, goes halfway in medium light, and closes in dim light. Additionally, the slave controls an RGB LED to indicate the temperature: green for cold, blue for moderate, and red for high temperatures. This allows the system to respond in real-time to environmental changes.
